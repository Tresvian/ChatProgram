Failure. Will recreate.

Reason: structure was fine, but the methods were too intrusive into other classes/threads that didn't make it easily maintainable nor readable.

11 Months Later: Overall pretty bad practices when it comes to my programming now. Version control is horrid, the documentation is non-existent. This was meant as my first medium-ish program that consisted of many working parts. The idea was good, and the planned parts too, but everything else was definitely good for study.
